# py-bool-logic

python boolean logic simulation implementation, for simulating circuits. but more for me because it's fun.

implemented basic logic gates like:

And, Or, Xor, Nand, Nor, Ior (inclussive or)

implemented circuits:

halfadder

fulladder

4bitadder

lots more to be added.

want to run some tests? have a look at LogicTests.py and call some of the functions and see what they do.

and how the call the logic circuits.


Testing software to build working circuits is falstad

can be found here: http://www.falstad.com/circuit/

if you download the java applet. and run the circuit.jar with:

java -jar circuit.jar

then you can import the circuits i made under falstad-circuits have a look :).
